My project is a game entitled Mega Monster Rampage, which is based off of the 
board game Monsters Menace America.  The folder containing it and all the 
images used in the game should be left intact, and after the user has installed
python, they should just double-click on the .py file for my game to launch it 
if using windows.  Otherwise, it can be launched like any regular python 
program.  Because no external modules were used, ther should be no issue with 
the game running this way.
